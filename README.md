# Raiduku

Minimalist World of Warcraft addon to help raid leaders managing loots and prios in Burning Crusade Classic.

## Why this addon?

- Not every raider needs to install it. Only the one managing loots.
- Not intrusive. You can still attribute loot manually.
- Supports +1 system, automatically order and designate the winner.
- Supports [thatsmybis.com](https://thatsmybis.com) allowing you to import prios and export loot history (even if manually attributed).
- Supports [softres.it](https://softres.it).
